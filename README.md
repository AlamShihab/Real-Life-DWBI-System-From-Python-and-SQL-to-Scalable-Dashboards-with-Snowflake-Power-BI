## 📊 **Project Title:**

**Real-Life DWBI System: From Python & SQL to Scalable Dashboards with Snowflake & Power BI**

---

### 🚀 **Project Overview:**

This end-to-end **Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DWBI)** project simulates a real-world analytics pipeline. The objective was to **define and deliver scalable metrics, reporting platforms, dashboards, and analytical models** vital for tracking and managing business performance.
As part of the project, I:

🧹 Gathered and cleaned datasets from multiple data sources using Python, ensuring high data quality through appropriate data validation processes.

🧪 Generated realistic test data programmatically and built an ER diagram to model business processes accurately.

🧱 Designed and implemented Star and Snowflake schemas to enable efficient querying and reporting on business dimensions and fact tables.

🧠 Created and optimized SQL scripts to solve real-world analytical scenarios, supporting business case resolution through meaningful insights.

🔄 Developed an ETL/ELT workflow using Python and Snowflake, building a scalable data pipeline that serves as the foundation of the BI system.

🤝 Collaborated across simulated functions—Sales, Marketing, and Operations—to define performance metrics and business KPIs.

📊 Delivered interactive and actionable dashboards in Power BI, using visual storytelling to communicate trends and data-driven insights effectively to business stakeholders.

🔍 Built a framework to spot critical insights, improve data flow processes, and align analytics with strategic business goals.

📈 Demonstrated capabilities in forecasting and analytical modeling, aligning closely with business needs for predictive insights and long-term planning.
